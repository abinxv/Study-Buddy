| - **Interpolation** is the process of estimating values      |
|   between known data points.                                 |
| - Common methods:                                            |
|    ▪ **Linear Interpolation**: Assumes a straight line       |
|      between two points.                                     |
|    ▪ **Lagrange Interpolation**: Uses polynomials to estimate|
|      values.                                                 |
|    ▪ **Newton's Divided Difference**: A method based on      |
|      successive differences.                                 |
| - Interpolation is used in numerical analysis, graph plotting|
|   📊, and data estimation.                                   |
