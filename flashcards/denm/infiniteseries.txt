| - **Tests for convergence** are crucial to determine if an   |
|   infinite series sums to a finite value or diverges 🔄.     |
| - Common tests include **Cauchy's Test**, **D'Alembert's Test**|
|   and **Comparison Test** 🔍.                                |

| **Cauchy's Convergence Test**:                               |
|    ▪ Helps to determine if a series converges by examining   |
|      the limit of its partial sums 💯.                       |
|    ▪ If the sequence of partial sums tends to a finite value,|
|      the series converges.                                   |
|                                                              |
| **D'Alembert's Ratio Test**:                                 |
|    ▪ Uses the ratio of consecutive terms to check convergence|
|      or divergence.                                          |
|    ▪ If lim(n → ∞) (a_{n+1} / a_n) < 1, the series converges.|
|    ▪ If the ratio is greater than 1, the series diverges. 📉  |
|                                                              |
| **Comparison Test**:                                         |
|    ▪ Compares the given series with a known convergent or    |
|      divergent series 📊.                                    |
|    ▪ If the given series is smaller than a convergent series,|
|      it converges.                                           |
|    ▪ If it's larger than a divergent series, it diverges.    |
