|       **STL (Standard Template Library)**                   |
|                                                             |
| - **STL** is a collection of template classes               |
|   and functions that provide **generic** data               |
|   structures and algorithms.                                |
| - Major components of STL:                                  |
|    - **Containers**: Data structures like                   |
|      vectors, lists, and maps.                              |
|    - **Algorithms**: Functions like sort, find,             |
|      and merge.                                             |
|    - **Iterators**: Used to iterate over containers.        |
| - **Benefits**: Reusable, efficient, and well-tested.       |
| - Widely used in C++ programming for clean and              |
|   optimized code.                                           |
