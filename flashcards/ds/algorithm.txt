| - **Algorithm Analysis** evaluates the time and            |
|   space complexity of algorithms.                          |
| - Two major factors:                                       |
|    - **Time Complexity**: How the algorithm’s              |
|      execution time increases with input size.             |
|    - **Space Complexity**: How the algorithm’s             |
|      memory requirements grow with input size.             |
| - **Big-O Notation**: Commonly used to describe            |
|   performance (e.g., O(n), O(log n), etc.).                |
| - Helps in choosing the most efficient algorithm           |
|   for a given problem .                                    |
| - Important for optimizing software performance.           |
