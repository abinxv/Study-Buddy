|        **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**                |
|                                                             |
| - **OOP** is a programming paradigm based on                |
|   the concept of objects.                                   |
| - Core principles of OOP:                                   |
|    - **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and                   |
|      methods into a single unit (class).                    |
|    - **Inheritance**: Reusing code by inheriting            |
|      properties from another class.                         |
|    - **Polymorphism**: Objects behaving                     |
|      differently based on their data type.                  |
|    - **Abstraction**: Hiding complex details                |
|      from the user and showing only essential               |
|      features.                                              |
| - OOP promotes code reuse, scalability, and                 |
|   easier maintenance.                                       |
|                                                             |
| **Applications**: Software development, game                |
| programming, and more!                                      |
