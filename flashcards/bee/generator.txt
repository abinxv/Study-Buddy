| - A DC Generator converts mechanical energy into electrical  |
|   energy through electromagnetic induction.                  |
| - The armature rotates in a magnetic field, inducing voltage.|
| - Commutator: It ensures the output is DC by reversing the   |
|   current in the armature windings as it rotates.            |
| - Key applications:                                          |

|    > Battery charging.                                       |
|    > Industrial machinery.                                   |
| - DC Generators provide a constant output voltage.           |
