| - A fuse is a safety device used to protect electrical       |
|   circuits from overcurrent.                                 |
| - It consists of a metal wire or filament that melts when    |
|   the current exceeds a safe limit.                          |
| - How it works:                                              |
|    > When the current is too high, the fuse wire melts,      |
|      breaking the circuit and preventing damage.             |
| - Types of fuses:                                            |
|    > Cartridge Fuse: Used in home circuits.                  |
|    > Plug Fuse: Often found in appliance circuits.           |
| - Fuses are simple, cost-effective, and easy to replace.     |
