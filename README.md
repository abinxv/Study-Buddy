# Study-Buddy
Study Buddy is a terminal based program that helps manage tasks and revise them with flashcards. 
It lets you add academic tasks with priorities and due times, and it automatically suggests flashcards based on the task’s topic.
You can track completed tasks using a queue, undo deletions with a stack, and save everything to files so your data isn’t lost. 
Tasks can also be viewed in alphabetical order. 
The project uses basic data structures like linked lists, stacks, graphs, queues, vectors, maps, etc.
